* DMA-BUF CMA Heap

Specifies a CMA region that should be added to the dma-buf heaps
interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "dmabuf-heap-cma"
- memory-region: phandle to a CMA reserved memory node

Example:
This example has a camera CMA node in reserved memory, which is then
referenced by the dmabuf-heap-cma node.


	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;
		...
		cma_camera: cma-camera {
			compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
			reg = <0x0 0x24C00000 0x0 0x4000000>;
			reusable;
		};
		...
	};

       cma_heap {
               compatible = "dmabuf-heap-cma";
               memory-region = <&cma_camera>;
        };
