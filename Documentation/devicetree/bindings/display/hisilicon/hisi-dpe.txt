Device-Tree bindings for hisilicon DPE display controller driver

DPE (DisPlay Engine) is the display controller which grab image data
from memory, do composition, do post image processing, generate RGB
timing stream and transfer to DSI.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "hisilicon,hi3660-dpe".
- reg: physical base address and length of the DPE controller's registers.
- interrupt: the ldi vblank interrupt number used.
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain:
  "aclk_dss"
  "pclk_dss"
  "clk_edc0"
  "clk_ldi0"
  "clk_ldi1"
  "clk_dss_axi_mm"
  "pclk_mmbuf"
- port: the output port. This contains one endpoint subnode, with its
  remote-endpoint set to the phandle of the connected DSI input endpoint.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt for more device graph info.

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent.
